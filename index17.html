                        read books in school, but you don't learn to watch movies. And without preparation, it can be
                        difficult to enjoy watching a movie.

                        acquainted with the stages of film production and learn how to watch a movie through the eyes of
                        a screenwriter, director and editor. We will understand genres and look at the most important
                        films, from Citizen Kane to The Matrix.</b></p>
